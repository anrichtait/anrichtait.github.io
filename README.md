# Anrich Tait - Temporary Site

This is a minimal, temporary version of my personal website while I work on a new Svelte-based site.

## What's Here

- **Home Page**: Simple "coming soon" message
- **Blog Archive**: Complete archive of all blog posts
- **Social Links**: Connect with me on GitHub and Instagram

## Site Structure

```
/                 - Coming soon page
/archive/         - Complete blog post archive
/[post-urls]/     - Individual blog posts (still accessible)
```

## About This Setup

This is a Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site that has been stripped down to the essentials:

- Removed: About, Contact, Gallery, Services pages
- Removed: Newsletter signup and complex widgets  
- Kept: All blog posts, social links, and clean navigation
- Added: Enhanced archive page with better styling

## Blog Posts

All previous blog posts remain accessible:
- Individual post URLs still work
- RSS feed (`/feed.xml`) still active
- Search functionality preserved
- All content and formatting maintained

## Social Links

- **GitHub**: [@anrichtait](https://github.com/anrichtait)
- **Instagram**: [@anrichtait](https://www.instagram.com/anrichtait/)

## Technical Details

- Built with Jekyll
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Uses the BlogBox theme (simplified)
- Responsive design maintained
- SEO and RSS feeds preserved
